# Introduction to Generative AI tools for Student Research

## Note: this workshop is in development and not yet complete.

Workshop participants will explore the use of Generative AI (GenAI) to assist with student research for idea generation, and literature reviews, and consider ethical considerations such as plagiarism, privacy, and research integrity. Participants will gain a basic understanding of GenAI and the ethical implications of its use in student research. In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tool usage and output evaluation for accuracy and biases. The workshop will also cover UBC policies, attribution methods, library resources, and campus support services, to encourage informed and responsible GenAI use.

This workshop is adapated from the Univeristy of Victoria's [https://uviclibraries.github.io/gen-ai-research/](https://uviclibraries.github.io/gen-ai-research/).


## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Explain what Generative AI is, define Generative AI and explain its relevance and potential applications in student research.
2. Discuss the ethical implications of using GenAI in academic work, including issues related to plagiarism, data privacy, and research integrity.
3. Critically evaluate common GenAI tools and their outputs, including assessing accuracy, relevance, and potential biases.
